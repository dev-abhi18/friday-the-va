# friday-the-va
friday is a voice assisstant developed by me and a friend (that got its name from you know where) does more or less everything a basic voice assistant should do
it greets you based on the time (i.e good morning/afternoon/evening) , tells you the time , can tell you the current weather of a location , opens youtube videos and google links 
speaks out wiki results, other than that there are a few easter eggs like (rickrolls etc ,refer the code for more)
doesn't have a gui yet , will integrate stuff like spotify etc.
